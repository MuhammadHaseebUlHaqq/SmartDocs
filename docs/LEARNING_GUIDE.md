## 1. Project Setup

### 1.1 Understanding the Tech Stack

  - Built-in admin interface for easy content management
  - Robust ORM for database operations
  - Django REST Framework for API development
  - Django Channels for WebSocket support
  - Strong security features out of the box
  - Excellent documentation and community support
  - Perfect for handling file uploads and processing
  - Easy integration with Python's AI/ML ecosystem

### 1.2 Development Environment Setup
#### Backend Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- Django 4.2+
- Django REST Framework
- Django Channels
- Virtual environment (venv or conda)
- PostgreSQL (recommended for production)

#### Key Django Concepts We'll Learn
- Django's MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture
- Django REST Framework for API development
- Django Channels for real-time features
- Django's authentication system
- Django's file handling and storage
- Django's admin interface
- Django's middleware and security features

### 1.3 Project Structure Explanation
(To be added as we create the structure)

## 2. Document Processing

### 2.1 Understanding Document Processing
- Document parsing concepts
- Chunking strategies
- Text extraction techniques

### 2.2 Vector Databases and Embeddings
- What are embeddings?
- Why use vector databases?
- Understanding similarity search

### 2.3 Implementation Details
#### Setting Up Document Processing
1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This installs required packages:
   - PyPDF2 for PDF processing
   - python-docx for DOCX processing
   - langchain for text chunking
   - openai for embeddings
   - numpy for vector operations

2. **Configure OpenAI API**
   Add to your Django settings (settings.py):
   ```python
   OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key-here'
   ```

#### Document Processing Flow
1. **Document Upload**
   - User uploads a document through the API
   - Document is saved to the database
   - Processing starts automatically in background

2. **Processing Steps**
   - Text extraction from document (PDF/DOCX)
   - Text chunking using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   - Embedding generation using OpenAI's embeddings
   - Storage of chunks and embeddings in database

3. **Status Monitoring**
   - Check processing status: `GET /api/documents/{id}/status/`
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket
   - Status states: "pending", "processing", "completed", "error"

4. **Querying Documents**
   - Available after processing completes
   - Endpoint: `POST /api/documents/{id}/query/`
   - Requires processed chunks and embeddings

#### Code Structure
```python
# processors.py
class DocumentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, document):
        self.document = document
        self.text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
            chunk_size=1000,
            chunk_overlap=200
        )
        self.embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

    def process_document(self):
        # 1. Extract text
        text_content = self.extract_text()
        
        # 2. Split into chunks
        chunks = self.text_splitter.split_text(text_content)
        
        # 3. Generate embeddings
        for chunk in chunks:
            embedding = self.embeddings.embed_query(chunk)
            # Store chunk and embedding
```

#### Best Practices
1. **Error Handling**
   - Validate file types before processing
   - Handle processing errors gracefully
   - Provide clear error messages to users

2. **Performance**
   - Process documents in background threads
   - Use appropriate chunk sizes for your use case
   - Cache embeddings when possible

3. **Security**
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Sanitize extracted text
   - Secure API key storage

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track processing status
   - Log errors and processing times
   - Monitor API usage

#### Common Challenges and Solutions
1. **Large Documents**
   - Solution: Implement streaming processing
   - Break into smaller chunks
   - Use efficient text extraction

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Solution: Process in batches
   - Clear temporary data
   - Use efficient data structures

3. **API Rate Limits**
   - Solution: Implement rate limiting
   - Queue processing requests
   - Cache embeddings
